        fullDescription: `
          Kohei, better known online as Namaste Kohei (previously Violinist Khoei), is a Japanese musician, violinist, and YouTube content creator currently residing in Bandra, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. He is known for his love of Hindi and Bollywood music, often sharing violin covers of popular songs, cultural reaction videos, and vlogs about his life in India.
      
          Kohei was born in Zushi, Kanagawa, Japan, and began playing the violin at the age of three. He later moved to Tokyo and completed his musical education at the Tokyo College of Music. His fascination with international music led him to discover Indian music through A.R. Rahman's work in the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire. Inspired, he moved to India shortly after launching his YouTube channel in 2016.
      
          In India, Kohei immersed himself in the culture, learning Hindi at the Central Hindi Institute in Mysore, Karnataka. He became fluent in the language and joined the Symphony Orchestra of India in Mumbai, where he performed at high-profile events, including Isha Ambani's wedding ceremony at Jio Gardens alongside A.R. Rahman. His YouTube content includes violin covers of Bollywood songs, cultural comparisons, and street interviews with Indian tourists in Japan.
      
          Kohei has collaborated with and been mentioned by notable Indian YouTubers like CarryMinati, gaining recognition in the Indian online community. However, his activity on YouTube has been inconsistent since September 2021, following a controversy involving a music video he appeared in, which led to backlash and his subsequent withdrawal from creating content for India.
          🛑 He was active on YouTube from 2016 to 2021.
          🛑 As of 2025, he has not uploaded new videos, and his last community post was in late 2022, indicating a long hiatus.
